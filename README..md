## 📌 Overview
This project scrapes the latest **cocoon prices** from the [Karnataka Sericulture Department](https://karnatakasericulture.gov.in/) and displays them in a user-friendly format.  
The aim is to provide **real-time price updates** for farmers to make informed selling decisions.

## 🚀 Features
- Scrapes cocoon prices from official PDF files.
- Extracts and formats data in a clean table.
- Easy to run locally.
- Option to export results to CSV.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- `requests` – for fetching PDF files
- `pdfplumber` – for reading PDF content
- `pandas` – for data processing
- `beautifulsoup4` – for HTML parsing (if required)

Got it Chandu — you’re talking about your Silk Shield: AI-powered Sericulture Disease Detection and Climate-based Cocoon Optimization project with EfficientNetB3, cocoon price scraping, and Streamlit/Flask frontend.

Here’s a README.md you can directly use for GitHub:

🐛 Silk Shield: AI-powered Sericulture Disease Detection and Climate-based Cocoon Optimization
📌 Overview
Silk Shield is an AI-powered tool designed to assist sericulture farmers in diagnosing silkworm diseases and optimizing cocoon pricing decisions.
The system leverages EfficientNetB3 for disease classification, scrapes daily cocoon prices from the Karnataka Sericulture Department, and provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit/Flask.

This project aims to make disease detection faster, affordable, and accessible without relying on costly IoT devices.

✨ Features
Real-time Disease Detection 🩺
Upload an image of a silkworm and get instant disease classification.

Daily Cocoon Price Scraper 📊
Automatic scraping from the Karnataka Sericulture Department’s official site.

Farmer-Friendly Interface 💻
Easy-to-use web app powered by Streamlit/Flask.

Cost-Effective 💡
No IoT hardware required; purely AI & web-based.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning Model: EfficientNetB3 (Keras/TensorFlow)

Frontend: Streamlit / Flask

Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup4, Requests

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Deployment: Local / Cloud (Streamlit Share, Flask Server)
